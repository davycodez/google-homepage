Built a easy version of Google search homepage.
I learnt how to ;

   * Move a div around on the page
   * Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
   * Identify the background color of an existing webpage
   * Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
   * Center an element horizontally
   * Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
   * Use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
   * Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)

in the processing of building this mini project - Google Homepage.
